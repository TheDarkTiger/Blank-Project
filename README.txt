Blank Project


CC BY-SA

= What? =
This project is stupidly simple.
The batch file generates a blank project.
By now, it only works on windows.


= Why? =
Well, because I was bored to always create the same folders and files and everything for each of my new project.
Also, it kind of is a test projet to try my tool chain.
Feel free to use, copy, or whatever.


= How can I help? =
There is no need.
I mean, it's for my project, I highly doubt anyone else will be interested by it.
And if you really want to add things, you can always do a pull request, but I highly doubt that what other people want is what I want.
On the other hand, please do clone it and adapt it to your need. I would be happy to know that it helped you.
